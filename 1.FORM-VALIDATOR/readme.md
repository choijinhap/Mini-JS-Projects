# Review Learned Information

## HTML
1. Use label for 'input'

## CSS
1. flex

2. box-shadow

3. Position
- Position '.form-control' relative because I positioned the small tag(error message) absolute within the '.form-control'
- Position '.form-contrl label' block because they go on their own line

4. Var

5. Visibility:hidden
- '.form-control small' has visibility:hidden instead of display:none, because it just simply makes it invisible.
- On the contrary display:none will collapse around it.

## JS
1. 

# TO-DO
